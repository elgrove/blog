title: SSH file transfer with scp
description:

scp or secure copy is a \*nix utility for copying files over an SSH connection. The commands are pretty simple and I haven't needed to use any switches yet. Classic unix, doing one job and doing it very well.

To copy a local file to a remote machine:
```bash
scp /path/to/file username@server:/path/t
o/destination
```

And to copy a remote file to a local directory:
```bash
scp username@server:/path/to/file /path/to/destination
```
