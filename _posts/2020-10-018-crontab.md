title: Using crontab to schedule jobs on Linux

To edit the crontab, enter this. 

```
crontab -e
```

Depending on the linux distro, you may get an alert asking which text editor to use, I usually pick nano because vim baffles me.

If you don't and you need to force the use of a particular editor, use this:

```
EDITOR=nano crontab -e
```

Crontab syntax is explained in the file but basically it follows the format `min hour dom mth dow`, so every minute of every day would by `* * * * *`

The website [crontab.guru](crontab.guru) has a great crontab syntax generator if you're struggling.
