title: Syncing files with rsync
description: 
summary: 
---

The following will sync the contents of dir1 into dir2

```
rsync -avP --ignore-existing dir1/ dir2/

```

Note the trailing slash which means the *contents* of dir1, without this you move the whole folder dir1 inside of dir2


On the above command, the flags are:

-a means archive or sync  
-P can be very helpful. It combines the flags --progress (progress bar) and --partial (allows to resume if stopped)  
-n can be used for a dry run  

For syncing files, rather than copying outright, add `--ignore-existing` as the last flag, before dir1

It's also really handy for deleting folders containing many, many tiny files, faster than `rm`

For this purpose, use the following commands

```
mkdir empty_dir
rsync -a --delete empty_dir/    delete_dir/
```
